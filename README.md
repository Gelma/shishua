1. **Performance**: in number of CPU cycles spent per byte generated.
2. **Quality**: level at which it fails PractRand. We show a `>` if it did not fail.
   We put a question mark if we have not proved it.
3. **Seed correlation**: PractRand on interleaving of bytes from eight streams
   with seeds 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.
   We use PractRand with folding 2 and expanded tests.

On the subject of seed correlations, the `./sample-seed-fingerprints.sh` program
highlights additional anomalies:

- RC4 has weak seeds with heavy artefacts visible in the fingerprints.
- RomuTrio's fingerprints start with the same first character for all seeds.
